# css

The goal of `css` is to turn css files into tibbles

## Installation

You can install css from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("romainfrancois/css")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(css)

# one rstudio css theme
dracula <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/rstudio/", 
  "0d9d49aa8671527370c6c261fc031ae8a8081c45/src/gwt/src/",   
  "org/rstudio/studio/client/workbench/views/source/editors/text/themes/dracula.css"
)

# reading it with read_css
data <- read_css(dracula)

# ... now it's a tibble ... 
dplyr::glimpse(data)
DT::datatable(data)
```
